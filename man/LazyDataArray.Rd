\description{
A lazy representation of a DataArray that carries a selection spec rather
than data. Created when accessing variables from a Dataset opened via
\code{open_dataset()}. Data is only read from disk when \code{collect()} is called.

The selection spec accumulates as \code{sel()}/\code{isel()} calls are chained,
recording which dimensions have been narrowed and to what index ranges.
\code{collect()} translates the accumulated spec into a single GDAL
\code{mdim_array_read()} hyperslab call.
