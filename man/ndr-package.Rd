\title{ndr: Named-Dimension Arrays with Coordinate-Based Indexing}
\description{
Provides Variable, DataArray, and Dataset classes for N-dimensional arrays with named dimensions and coordinate-based indexing. Arithmetic operations broadcast by dimension name, not position. Designed as a minimal foundation for lazy, multi-file scientific data access — the core data structures without any file backends.
