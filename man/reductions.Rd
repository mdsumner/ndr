\title{Reductions along named dimensions}
\usage{
nd_mean(x, ...)

nd_sum(x, ...)

nd_min(x, ...)

nd_max(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Variable or DataArray}

\item{dims}{Character vector of dimension names to reduce over}

\item{na.rm}{Logical, whether to remove NAs}
}
\value{
Same type as input, with reduced dimensions dropped
}
\description{
Summarise a Variable or DataArray by applying a function along one or
more named dimensions. The reduced dimensions are dropped from the result.
}
\examples{
temp <- Variable(
  dims = c("time", "lat", "lon"),
  data = array(rnorm(10 * 3 * 4), c(10, 3, 4))
)

# Time mean
nd_mean(temp, "time")  # shape: lat=3, lon=4

# Spatial mean (reduce lat and lon)
nd_mean(temp, c("lat", "lon"))  # shape: time=10

# Global mean (reduce everything)
nd_mean(temp, c("time", "lat", "lon"))  # scalar

}
